## Purpose

The project will require integration with at least 6 publicly available APIs, and must have the framework to work with more using a unified framework.  [e.g. we want the ability to invite a user by email to a number of web services, and require that 'invite' work for all web services.]

## Brief overview of the site requirements:

1) Landing page
2) User registration/signin/password reset/simple team management
3) Email sending capability
4) Web service integration framework [example above]
5) Dashboard/item listing
